### About Me
Hi. I'm Aonan, an enthusiastic Front-End Developer at Tetrad Computer Applications, currently living in Vancouver, BC. I buid web applications and mobile app with React.js, C#, and React Native. Before I moved to Vancouver, I completed a Master of Computer Engineering program from Western University, London Ontario.

In my free time, I like to play guitar especially in fingerstyle. Check out some of the other tiles to learn a little more about me!
