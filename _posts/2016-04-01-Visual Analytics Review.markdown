### Introduction
In the early 2000s, Jim Thomas organized a team of top scientists to formally define a new research area, visual analytics, which was first defined as the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces in 2005. After that, a huge amount of work related to visual analytics has been done. Since Big Data is one of the most popular topics nowadays, visual analytics is becoming a worldwide research area with plenty applications to help decision-making and sense-making.

Compared to data mining or machine learning which is mostly developed with science and technology, visual analytics is more like a combination of art and science. The goal of visual analysis is to synthesize information and find significant patterns related to an issue from artistic visualizations of massive, dynamic and ambiguous data.

There are different types of data that have been visualized including text, transaction, spatio-temporal data, network flow data, social network and so on. The abundance of data category also indicates the broad range of application domains.

Among these data types, spatio-temporal data are always enormous and accessible such as daily trajectories of all the taxis in Toronto. It consists of geographic, temporal (time) and attributive components. As shown in its name, space and time are two most important factors of spatio-temporal data. There is a large amount of abnormal data observed globally. Spatiotemporal analysis focuses on detecting how both normal and abnormal behaviors change geographically as well as the interaction with temporal processes. For example, there are a huge number of trajectory records for Toronto taxis recorded every 20 seconds. Each of them contains a taxi ID, a GPS location, a time stamp, the speed and the occupancy status. It is impossible to detect useful patterns directly from the data, but a visual analytics system can make it. By visualizing this data set on a map with a timeline, significant movement trends can be found easily by users. If these trends show up regularly (most taxis drive from suburb to downtown in the morning), they are normal behaviors. If these trends show up for only several times (a large number of taxis drive to Riverdale Park this weekend), they are abnormal behaviors. By analyzing these behaviors, users can draw several conclusions like most people go to work at 8 A.M., or there is a music festival in Riverdale Part.

This paper provides a systematic literature review about visual analytics on spatial-temporal data. The goal of this work is to summarize and compare existing visual analytics techniques on spatio-temporal data. This paper is organized as follow: Section II provides detailed methodology adopted to perform the systematic literature review. Section III compares all the papers related to each research questions we raised in Section II and analyze the results to draw further conclusions. Section IV presents the limitations of this work and Section V addresses the conclusion of this paper.
