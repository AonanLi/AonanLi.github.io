### Introduction
Surgical simulation is becoming more practical for surgeons since these simulators help them to practice specific procedures before they carry on real surgeries, which can improve surgical proficiency and provide a zero-risk learning environment. Among different approaches of implementing the simulator, augmented reality technologies provide an effective simulation platform because the surgical environment is combined with users’ reality, which offers them similar experience as real surgical operations. However, to quantify and distinguish different levels of surgical skill, specific metrics should be used to evaluate surgeons’ performance in terms of speed and accuracy.

In this paper, we implement a simple tumor targeting task using Unity with the Vuforia augmented reality toolkit. We construct several ellipsoid targets of random positions within the mannequin head, and ask users to touch them with given surgical tool as quickly as possible. 2 users participated in the user study, and either of them completed 50 tasks for 3 times. Tumor positions and reaction time were recorded in order to measure users’ performance.
